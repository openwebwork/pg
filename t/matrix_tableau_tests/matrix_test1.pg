BEGIN_PGML
 
Create a matrix:   matrix m = [`[$m]`]

Matrix indices start at 1.

Extracting rows and columns from a matrix.  
These are best displayed in PGML within a list.
It is best to place them in the list outside of PGML and then display. 

You can also  group the extracted rows into a matrix and display. 

Matrix m = [`[$m]`]

List rows 4,1 of the matrix m :[` [@ List($m_rows) @] `], 

or create the list before hand [`[$m1list]`] 

or matrix version [`[$m1matrix]`]

You can do the same for columns. Notice that this does not
do exactly what you expect when you extract columns

matrix m = [`[$m]`]

List  columns 3,2,1 of the matrix m: [@ List($m_cols) @]

create the list before hand [`[$m2list]`]

or create matrix version [`[$m2matrix]`]


Using the \[@ ...  @\] escape to apply List doesn't 
always do the best job 
of interacting with TeX output as you can see in the first entries for List above.  

The two  entries below show what happens if you extract rows or 
columns into lists using 
the method $m->extract_rows_to_list(). 
It is the same as applying List() to the method 
$m->extract_rows outside of PGML.  

matrix:  [`[$m]`]

Find the list of columns 1,2 of the matrix [`[$list_cols]`]

Find the list of rows 2,3 of the matrix [`[$list_rows]`]

The next two entries illustrate the $m->row_slice, $m->column_slice methods for shuffling or 
selecting rows or columns from a matrix. The return type is Value::Matrix.  The column
selection is done by doing row selection on the transpose -- this does what you expect
when selecting columns.

Row slice (4,1) [`[$m3]`]

Column slice (3,2,1) [`[$m4]`]

This final group selects a rectangular submatrix of a matrix. ->submatrix.

Select \[2,3\]x\[1,2\] to get [`[$submatrix1]`] of [`[$m]`]

Select \[2,3\]x all to get  [`[$submatrix2]`]

Select all x \[1,2\] to get [`[$submatrix3]`]
