$PAR
A very small negatively-charged conducting sphere is suspended 
by an insulating thread from support S. 
It is placed close to a vertical metal plate carrying a positive charge. 
The sphere is attracted towards the plate and hangs with the thread at an 
angle of 20\(^{\circ}\) to the vertical as shown in the figure.

$PAR 
(a) The sphere of weight $w \(\times 10^{-5}\) N carries a charge of -$q \(\times 10^{-9}\) C. 
Find the magnitude of the attractive force between the sphere and the plate.

$PAR
\( F = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
(b) Determine the magnitude of the electric field strength at the sphere, 
treated as a point charge.

$PAR
\( E = \) \{ ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR

$PAR
(c) The plate is removed. The diagram below shows an identical sphere 
carrying a charge of +$q \(\times 10^{-9}\) C, mounted on an insulating stand.
It is placed so that the hanging sphere remains at 20\(^{\circ}\) to the vertical. 
Treating the spheres as point charges, calculate the distance r between their centres.
