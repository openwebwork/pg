answerCustom.pl - provides custom answer checkers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This macro provides methods for creating answer checkers with a custom
subroutine that performs the check for correctness.  A similar method is provided
for lists.

=head2 custom_cmp

    ANS(custom_cmp($correct_ans, $ans_checker, %options))

This answer checker provides an easy method for creating an answer
checker with a custom subroutine that performs the check for
correctness.

Pass the correct answer (either as a string or as a Parser object)
as the first argument, and a reference to the checker subroutine
as the second argument.  Additional parameters can follow.  These
include any of the parameters for the usual answer checker of the
of the type of the correct answer (e.g., showCoordinateHints), plus
the following:

=over

=item S<C<< sameClass => 0 or 1 >>>

If 1 (the default), only call the custom checker if the student answer
is the same object class as the correct answer (e.g., both are points).
If 0, the checker will be called whenever the student answer passes
the typeMatch check for the correct answer.  For example, if the correct
answer is a vector, and promotePoints has been set to 1, then the checker
will be called when the student answer is a vector OR a point.

=item S<C<< sameLength => 0 or 1 >>>

If 1 (the default), only call the custom checker if the student answer
has the same number of coordinates as the correct answer.

=back

If the correct answer is a list, the custom checker will be called
on the individual entries of the list, not on the list as a whole.
If the list is an unordered list, the routine may be called
multiple times with various combinations of student and professor's
answers in order to find a correct match.

Note: If you want a correct answer whose class is a complex variable
to check a real number entry you will have to set both sameClass and
sameLength to 0 since a complex number has length 2 and a real number
has length 1.

The checker routine will be passed the correct answer, the
student's answer, and the answer evaluator object, in that order.

For example, the following checks if a student entered
a unit vector (any unit vector in R^3 will do):

    ANS(custom_cmp("<1,0,0>",sub {
    	my ($correct,$student,$ans) = @_;
    	return norm($student) == 1;
    },showCoordinateHints => 0));

The checker subroutine can call Value::Error(message) to generate
an error message that will be reported in the table at the top of
the page.  If the checker generates a fatal runtime error (e.g.,
calls the "die" function), then the message is reported with the
"pink screen of death", and includes a request for the student to
inform the instructor.

		@custom_cmp_defaults,

	);

#  to include in the custom answer checkers

=head2 custom_list_cmp

    ANS(custom_list_cmp($correct_ans, $ans_checker, %options))

This one installs a custom list-based answer checker (for the
List and Union classes).  Basically it is just a shell that makes
it a little easier to do, and provides an interface similar to
custom_cmp.

You pass the correct answer (as a string or as a List or Union
object) as the first argument, and the custom list checker as
the second argument.  You can pass any additional parameters
that should be included in the answer checker following those
two required ones.

The checker will be passed a reference to the array of correct
answers, a reference to the array of student answers, and
the answer evaluator object.  Note that the correct and student
answers are array references, not List structures (this is because
a list of formulas becomes a formula returning a list, so in order
to keep the formulas separate, they are passed in an array).

The checker should return the number of list entries that were
matched by the students answers.  (I.e., a number between 0
and the length of the list.)

For example, the following checks for any list of the same length
as the instructor's list.  (A stupid checker, but just an example.)

    ANS(custom_list_cmp("1,2,3",sub {
        my ($correct,$student,$ans) = @_;
        (scalar(@{$correct}) == scalar(@{$student}) ? 3 : 0);
    }));

The checker subroutine can call Value::Error(message) to generate
an error message that will be reported in the table at the top of
the page.  If the checker generates a fatal runtime error (e.g.,
calls the "die" function), then the message is reported with the
"pink screen of death", and includes a request for the student to
inform the instructor.
