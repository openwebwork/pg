=head1 NAME

parserDifferenceQuotient.pl - An answer checker for difference quotients.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Parser class that implements an answer checker for
difference quotients as a subclass of the Formula class.  The
standard ->cmp routine will work for this.  The difference quotient
is just a special type of formula with a special variable
for 'dx'.  The checker will give an error message if the
student's result contains a dx in the denominator, meaning it
is not fully reduced.

Use DifferenceQuotient(formula) to create a difference equation
object.  If the context has more than one variable, the last one
alphabetically is used to form the dx.  Otherwise, you can specify
the variable used for dx as the second argument to
DifferenceQuotient().  You could use a variable like h instead of
dx if you prefer.  This is specified in the second argument.
If you want to identify division by zero when a value other than
zero is substituted in for dx (or h), then the third argument is a 
number to be substituted into the variable named in the second 
argument.  The third argument is optional and the default value
0 is used when the third argument is omitted.

=head1 USAGE

        # simplify (f(x+dx)-f(x)) / dx for f(x)=x^2
	$df = DifferenceQuotient("2x+dx");
	ANS($df->cmp);

        # simplify (f(x+h)-f(x)) / h for f(x) = x^2
	$df = DifferenceQuotient("2x+h","h");
	ANS($df->cmp);
	
        # simplify (f(t+dt)-f(t)) / dt for f(t)=a/t
	Context()->variables->are(t=>'Real',a=>'Real');
	ANS(DifferenceQuotient("-a/[t(t+dt)]","dt")->cmp);

        # simplify (f(x)-f(c)) / (x-c) for f(x)=x^2 at c=3
	$df = DifferenceQuotient("x+3","x",3);

        # simplify (x^2 - 4) / (x-2)
        $df = DifferenceQuotient("x+2","x",2);
	ANS($df->cmp);
