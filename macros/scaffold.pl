=head1 NAME

scaffold.pl - Provides support for multi-part problems where
              later parts are not visible until earlier parts
              are completed correctly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scaffolding macros provide the ability to make a single problem file
contain multiple parts, where the later parts aren't visible to the
student until the earlier ones are completed.  The author has control
over which parts are allowed to be opened, and which are showing, but
does not have to keep track of what answer blanks go with which
sections (as was the case in the earlier compoundProblem macros). It
is even possible to have nested scaffolds within a single problem.

To use the scaffolding macros, include the macros into your problem

    loadMacros("scaffold.pl");

and then use C<Scaffold::Begin()> to start a scaffold problem and
C<Scaffold::End()> to end it.  In between, use
C<Section::Begin(title)> and C<Section::End()> around the sections of
your problem.  Within a section, use C<BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT> or
C<BEGIN_PGML/END_PGML> to create the text of the section as usual, and
C<ANS()> to assign answer checkers to the blanks that appear within
the section.  For example:

    Scaffold::Begin();
    
    Section::Begin("Part 1: The first part");
    BEGIN_TEXT
    This is the text for part 1.  \(1+1\) = \{ans_rule\}
    END_TEXT
    ANS(Real(2)->cmp);
    Section::End();
    
    Section::Begin("Part 2: The second part");
    BEGIN_TEXT
    This is text for the second part.  \(2*2\) = \{ans_rule\}
    END_TEXT
    ANS(Real(4)->cmp);
    Section::End();
    
    Scaffold::End();

You can include whatever code you need to between the
C<Section::Begin()> and C<Section::End()> calls, so you can create
variables, set the Context, perform computations, generate text
sections, and so on.  Whatever answer checkers are assigned within a
section are the ones that are used to decide when that section can be
opened by the student.  Any solutions created within a section become
part of that section, and will be made available from within that
section, when applicable.

A section is considered to be "correct" when all the answers contained
in it are correct.  Note that essay answers are treated specially, and
are always considered correct (when non-empty) for purposes of
determining when a section is correct.  You can also force a non-empty
answer blank to be considered correct by using the C<scaffold_force>
option on the answer checker.  For example:

    ANS(Real(123)->cmp(scaffold_force => 1));

would mean that this answer would not have to be correct for the
section to be considered correct.

Note that you can also create text (or even answer blanks and
checkers) between the sections, or before the first one, or after the
last one, if you wish.  That material would always be showing,
regardless of which sections are open. So, for example, you could put
a data table in the area before the first section, so that it would be
visible throughtout the problem, no matter which section the student
is working on.

The C<Scaffold::Begin()> function accepts optional parameters that
control the functioning of the scaffold as a whole.  The primary use
it to control when the sections can be opened by the student, and
which is currently open.  The following options are provided:

=over

=item C<S<< can_open => condition >>> 

This specifies when a section can be opened by the student.  The
C<condition> is either one of the strings C<"always">,
C<"when_previous_correct">, C<"first_incorrect">, C<"incorrect"> or
C<"never">, or is a reference to a subroutine that returns 0 or 1
depending on whether the section can be opened or not (the subroutine
is passed a reference to the section object).  The default value is
C<"when_previous_correct">, which means that all the correct sections
and the first section incorrect or empty blanks would be able to be
opened by the student.  The value C<"first_incorrect"> would mean that
correct sections can not be reopened, and only the first one that is
not fully correct can be, while C<"incorrect"> means that only
incorrect sections can be opened (so once a section is correct, it
can't be reopened).  The value C<"always"> means the student can
always open the section, and C<"never"> means that the section can
never be opened.

If answers are available (i.e., it is after the answer date), then the
C<after_AnswerDate_can_open> option (described below) is used instead
of this option.  If not and the user is a professor, then the
C<instructor_can_open> option (described below) is used instead.

=item C<S<< is_open => condition >>>

This is similar to the C<can_open> option above, but determines
whether the section will be open when the problem is displayed.  The
possible values are C<"always">, C<"incorrect">, C<"first_incorrect">,
C<"correct_or_first_incorrect">, C<"never">, or a reference to a
subroutine that returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the section should
be open or not (the subroutine is passed a reference to the section
object).  Note that a section will only open if the C<can_open>
condition is also met, so you do need to coordinate these two values.
The default is C<"first_incorrect">, which means that only the first
section with incorrect answers will be open when the problem is
displayed after answers are submitted (though the student may be abe
to open other sections afterward, depending on the value if C<can_open>.
The value C<"incorrect"> would mean that all incorrect or incomplete
sections are open (the student can see all future work that he or she
must complete) but correct sections are closed, while
C<"correct_or_first_incorrect"> would be the opposite: all correct
sections and the first incorrect one are opened while the later
sections are closed (the student can see the completed work, but not
the future sections).  As expected, C<"always"> would mean every
section that can be opened will be open, and C<"never"> means no
section is opened.

Hardcopy versions of the problem use the C<hardcopy_is_open> option
(described below).

=item C<S<< instructor_can_open => condition >>>

This provides the condition for when an instructor (as opposed to a
student) can open a section.  By default, this is set to C<"always">,
so that instructors can look at any section of the problem, but you
can set it to any value for C<can_open> above.  If you are an
instructor and want to test how a problem looks for a student, you can
set

    $Scaffold::isInstructor = 0;

temporarily while testing the problem.  Remember to remove that when
you are done, however.

=item C<S<< after_AnswerDate_can_open => condition >>>

This is similar to the C<can_open> option (described above), and is
used in place of it when the answers are available.  The default is
C<"always">.  That means that after the answer date, the student will
be able to open all the sections regardless of whether the answers are
correct or not.

=item C<S<< hardcopy_is_open => condition >>>

This is similar to the C<is_open> option (described above), and is
used in place of it when the problem appears in hardcopy output.  The
default is C<"always">, which means that any sections that can be open
will be open in hardcopy output.  This allows the student to see the
parts of the problem that are already complete, even if they don't
open when viewed on line.

=item C<S<< open_first_section => 0 or 1 >>>

This determines whether the initial section is open (when it can be).
With the default C<can_open> and C<is_open> settings, the first
section will be open automatically when the problem is first viewed,
but if you have material to read (or even answers to give) prior to
the first section, you might want the first section to be closed, and
have the student open it by hand before anwering the questions.  In
this case, set this value to 0 (it is 1 by default).

=back

Some useful configurations are:

    #
    #  The defaults:
    #    only the active section is open, but students can open
    #    previous correct sections if they want.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "when_previous_correct",
      is_open  => "first_incorrect"
    );
    
    #
    #  Sections stay open as the student works through
    #  the problem.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "when_previous_correct",
      is_open  => "correct_or_first_incorrect"
    );
    
    #
    #  Students work through the problem seeing only
    #  one section at a time, and can't go back to
    #  previous sections.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "first_incorrect",
      is_open  => "first_incorrect"
    );
    
    #
    #  Students can view and work on any section,
    #  but only the first incorrect one is shown initially.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "always",
      is_open  => "first_incorrect"
    );
    
    #
    #  Students see all the parts initially, but the
    #  sections close as the student gets them correct.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "always",
      is_open  => "incorrect"
    );
    
    #
    #  Students see all the parts initially, but the
    #  sections close as the student gets them correct,
    #  and can't be reopened.
    #
    Scaffold::Begin(
      can_open => "incorrect",
      is_open  => "incorrect"
    );

The C<Section::Begin()> macro also accepts the options C<can_open>,
C<is_open>, and C<instructor_can_open> described above.  This allows
you to override the defaults for a particular section.  In particular,
you can provide a subroutine that determines when the section can or
should be open.

Note that values like C<$showPartialCorrectAnswers> and the isntalled
grader are global to the whole problem, so can't be set individually
on a per section basis.  Also note that the answers aren't checked
until the end of the problem, so any changes you make to the
C<Context()> after a section is ended will still affect the context
within that section.
