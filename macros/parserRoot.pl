=head1 NAME

parserRoot.pl - defines a root(n,x) function for n-th root of x.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file defines the code necessary to add to any context a
root(n,x) function that performs the n-th root of x.  For example,
Compute("root(3,27)") would return the equivalent of Real(3).

To accomplish this, put the line

	loadMacros("parserRoot.pl");

at the beginning of your problem file, then set the Context to the one
you wish to use in the problem.  Then use the command:

	parser::Root->Enable;

(You can also pass the Enable command a pointer to a context if you
wish to alter a context other than the current one.)

Once that is done, you (and students) can enter roots by using the
root() function.  You can use root() both within Formula() and
Compute() calls, and in Perl expressions, such as

        $n = root(3,27);

to obtain n-th roots.

  my $self = shift;
  my $context = shift;
  $context = main::Context() unless Value::isContext($context);
  $context->functions->add(

  );
}

sub root {
  shift; my $n = shift; my $x = shift;
  return $x**(1/$n);
}

sub TeX {
  my $self = shift;
  my ($n,$x) = ($self->{params}[0],$self->{params}[1]);
  return '\sqrt['.$n->TeX."]{".$x->TeX."}";
}
