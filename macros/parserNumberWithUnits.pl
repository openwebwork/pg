parserNumberWithUnits.pl - Implements a number with units.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Parser class that implements a number with units.
It is a temporary version until the Parser can handle it
directly.

Use NumberWithUnits("num units") or NumberWithUnits(formula,"units")
to generate a NumberWithUnits object, and then call its cmp method
to get an answer checker for your number with units.

Usage examples:

	ANS(NumberWithUnits("3 ft")->cmp);
	ANS(NumberWithUnits("$a*$b ft")->cmp);
	ANS(NumberWithUnits($a*$b,"ft")->cmp);

We now call on the Legacy version, which is used by
num_cmp to handle numbers with units.

New units can be added at run time by using the newUnit option

       $a = NumberWithUnits("3 apples",{newUnit=>'apples'});

A new unit can either be a string, in which case the string is added as a
new unit with no relation to other units, or as a hashreference

       $newUnit = {name => 'bear',
                   conversion => {factor =>3, m=>1}};
       $a = NumberWithUnits("3 bear", {newUnit=>$newUnit});

You can also define your own conversion hash.  In the above example one bear
is three meters.  (See Units.pm for examples). 

Finally, the newUnit option can also be an array ref containing any number of
new units to add.  A common reason for doing this would be to add the plural
version of the unit as an equilvalent unit.  E.G.

      $newUnits = ['apple',{name=>'apples',conversion=>{factor=>1,apple=>1}}];
      $a = NumberWithUnits("3 apples",{newUnit=>$newUnits});

In this case both 3 apple and 3 apples would be considered correct.  

Note:  English pluralization is suprisingly hard, so WeBWorK will make no 
attempt to display a grammerically correct result.
