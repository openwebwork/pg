######################################################################
#
#  This package implements a method of handling multi-part problems
#  that show only a single part at any one time.  The students can
#  work on one part at a time, and then when they get it right (or
#  under other circumstances deterimed by the professor), they can
#  move on to the next part.  Students can not return to earlier parts
#  once they have been completed.  The score for problem as a whole is
#  made up from the scores on the individual parts, and the relative
#  weighting of the various parts can be specified by the problem
#  author.
#
#  To use the compoundProblem library, use
#
#      loadMacros("compoundProblem.pl");
#
#  at the top of your file, and then create a compoundProblem object
#  via the command
#
#      $cp = new compoundProblem(options)
#
#  where '$cp' is the name of a variable that you will use to
#  refer to the compound problem, and 'options' can include:
#
#    parts => n                The number of parts in the problem.
#                                Default: 1
#
#    weights => [n1,...,nm]    The relative weights to give to each
#                              part in the problem.  For example,
#                                  weights => [2,1,1]
#                              would cause the first part to be worth 50%
#                              of the points (twice the amount for each of
#                              the other two), while the second and third
#                              part would be worth 25% each.  If weights
#                              are not supplied, the parts are weighted
#                              by the number of answer blanks in each part
#                              (and you must provide the total number of
#                              blanks in all the parts by supplying the
#                              totalAnswers option).
#
#    totalAnswers => n         The total number of answer blanks in all
#                              the parts put together (this is used when
#                              computing the per-part scores, if part
#                              weights are not provided).
#
#    saveAllAnswers => 0 or 1  Usually, the contents of named answer blanks
#                              from previous parts are made available to
#                              later parts using variables with the
#                              same name as the answer blank.  Setting
#                              saveAllAnswers to 1 will cause ALL answer
#                              blanks to be available (via variables
#                              like $AnSwEr1, and so on).
#                                 Default:  0
#
#    parserValues => 0 or 1    Determines whether the answers from previous
#                              parts are returned as MathObjects (like
#                              those returned from Real(), Vector(), etc)
#                              or as strings (the unparsed contents of the
#                              student answer).  If you intend to use the
#                              previous answers as numbers, for example,
#                              you would want to set this to 1 so that you
#                              would get the final result of any formula
#                              the student typed, rather than the formula
#                              itself as a character string.
#                                 Default:  0
#
#    nextVisible => type       Tells when the "go on to the next part" option
#                              is available to the student.  The possible
#                              types include:
#
#                                 'ifCorrect'   next is available only when
#                                               all the answers are correct.
#
#                                 'Always'      next is always available
#                                               (but remember that students
#                                               can't go back once they go
#                                               on.)
#
#                                 'Never'       next is never allowed (the
#                                               problem will control going
#                                               on to the next part itself).
#
#                                Default:  'ifCorrect'
#
#    nextStyle => type         Determines the style of "next" indicator to display
#                              (when it is available).  The type can be one of:
#
#                                 'CheckBox'    a checkbox that allows the students
#                                               to go on to the next part when they
#                                               submit their answers.
#
#                                 'Button'      a button that submits their answers
#                                               and goes on to the next part.
#
#                                 'Forced'      forces the student to go on to the
#                                               next part the next time they submit
#                                               answers.
#
#                                 'HTML'        allows you to provide an arbitrary
#                                               HTML string of your own.
#
#                                Default:  'Checkbox'
#
#    nextLabel => string       Specifies the string to use as the label for the checkbox,
#                              the name of the button, the text of the message indicating
#                              that the next submit will move to the next part, or the
#                              HTML string, depending on the setting of nextStyle above.
#
#    nextNoChange => 0 or 1    Since the students must submit their answers again to go on
#                              to the next part, it is possible for them to change their
#                              answers before they submit, and if nextVisible is 'ifCorrect'
#                              they might go on to the next without having correct answers
#                              stored.  This option lets you control whether the answers
#                              are checked against the previous ones before going on to the
#                              next part.  If the answers don't match, a warning is issued
#                              and they are not allowed to move on.
#                                Default:  1
#
#    allowReset => 0 or 1      Determines whether a "Go back to the first part" checkbox
#                              is provided on parts 2 and later.  This is intended for
#                              the professor during testing of the problem (otherwise
#                              it would be impossible to go back to earlier parts).
#                                Default:  0
#
#    resetLabel => string      The string used to label the reset checkbox.
#
#  Once you have created a compoundProblem object, you can use $cp->part to
#  determine the part that the student is working on, and use 'if' statements
#  to display the proper information for the given part.  The compoundProblem
#  object takes care of maintaining the data as the parts change.  (See the
#  compoundProblem.pg file for an example of a compound problem.)
#
#  In order to handle the scoring of the problem as a whole when only part is
#  showing, the compoundProblem object uses its own problem grader to manage
#  the scores, and calls your own grader from there.  The default is to use
#  the one that was installed before the compoundProblem object was created,
#  or avg_problem_grader if none was installed.  You can specify a different
#  one using the $cp->useGrader() method (see below).  It is important that
#  you NOT call install_problem_grader() yourself once you have created the
#  compoundProblem object, as that would disable the special grader, causing
#  the compound problem to fail to work properly.
#
#  You may call the following methods once you have a compoundProblem:
#
#    $cp->part                   Returns the part the student is working on.
#    $cp->part(n)                Sets the part to be part n, as long as the
#                                student has finished the preceeding parts.
#                                If not, the part is set to the highest
#                                one the student hasn't completed, and he
#                                can work up to the given part.  (The
#                                nextVisible option is set to 'ifCorrect' if
#                                it was 'Never' so that students can go on
#                                once they finish the earlier parts.)
#
#    $cp->useGrader(code_ref)    Supplies your own grader to use in
#                                place of the default one.  For example:
#                                  $cp->useGrader(~~&std_problem_grader);
#
#    $cp->score                  Returns the (weighted) score for this part.
#                                Note that this is the score shown at the bottom
#                                of the page on which the student pressed submit
#                                (not the score for the answers the student is
#                                submitting -- that is not available until
#                                after the body of the problem has been created).
#
#    $cp->scoreRaw               Returns the unweighted score for this part.
#
#    $cp->scoreOverall           Returns the overall score for the problem
#                                so far.
#
#    $cp->addAnswers(list)       Make additional answer blanks be available
#                                from one part to another.  E.g.,
#                                   $cp->addAnswers('AnSwEr1');
#                                would make the first unnamed blank be available
#                                in later parts as well.  (This command should
#                                be issued only when the part containing the
#                                given answer blank is displayed.)
#
#    $cp->nextCheckbox(label)    Returns the HTML string for the "go on to next
#                                part" checkbox so you can use it in the body of
#                                the problem if you wish.  This should not be
#                                inserted when the $displayMode is 'TeX'.  If the
#                                label is not given or is blank, the default label
#                                is used.
#
#    $cp->nextButton(label)      Returns the HTML string for the "go on to next
#                                part" button so you can use it in the body of
#                                the problem if you wish.  This should not be
#                                inserted when the $displayMode is 'TeX'.  If the
#                                label is not given or is blank, the default label
#                                is used.
#
#    $cp->nextForces(label)      Returns the HTML string for the forced "go on to
#                                next part" so you can use it in the body of
#                                the problem if you wish.  This should not be
#                                inserted when the $displayMode is 'TeX'.  If the
#                                label is not given or is blank, the default label
#                                is used.
#
#    $cp->reset                  Go back to part 1, clearing the answers
#                                and score.  (Best used when debugging problems.)
#
#    $cp->resetCheckbox(label)   Returns the HTML string for the reset checkbox
#                                so that you can provide one within the body
#                                of the problem if you wish.  This should not be
#                                inserted when the $displayMode is 'TeX'.  If the
#                                label is not given or is blank, the default label
#                                will be used.
