=head1 NAME

source.pl - allow the source of the problem to be shown.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

activating the source button

In order for this button to work the course needs to have a link from

    myCourse/html/show-source.cgi to webwork2/htdocs/show-source.cgi

in the directory myCourse/html.  To create this link execute the following
command (you will need command line access to the server to do this)

    ln -s /opt/webwork/webwork2/htdocs/show-source.cgi    show-source.cgi

You need to make sure that the file webwork2/htdocs/show-source.cgi is executable by the
apache webserver.

To accomplish this you need to uncomment this line in webwork.apache2-config

    ScriptAliasMatch /webwork2_course_files/([^/]*)/show-source.cgi/(.*) /opt/webwork/courses/$1/html/show-source.cgi/$2

The show-source.cgi script may also have to be customized to set C<$root> to the webwork2 directory
