=head1 NAME

draggableSubsets.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This macro helps the instructor create a drag-and-drop environment in which a
pre-specified set of elements may be dragged to different "buckets", effectively
partitioning the original set into subsets.

=head1 TERMINOLOGY

An HTML element into or out of which other elements may be dragged will be
called a "bucket".

An HTML element which houses a collection of buckets will be called a "bucket
pool".

=head1 USAGE

To initialize a C<DraggableSubset> bucket pool in a .pg problem, insert the line

    $draggable = DraggableSubsets(
        $full_set,
        $answer_sets,
        option1 => $value1,
        option2 => $value2,
        ...
    );

Then insert the draggable subset bucket pool into the problem text with

    BEGIN_TEXT
    \{$draggable->ans_rule\}
    END_TEXT

for basic PG, or

    BEGIN_PGML
    [_]{$draggable}
    END_PGML

for PGLM.  Note the following also works, but is deprecated.  However, if you
want your problem to be compatible with previous versions of PG this must be
used.  Call

    \{$draggable->Print\} (or [@ $draggable->Print @]* for PGML)

within the BEGIN_TEXT / END_TEXT (or BEGIN_PGML / END_PGML ) environment.
Then call

    ANS($draggable->cmp)

after END_TEXT (or END_PGML).

$full_set, e.g. ["statement1", "statement2", ...], is an array reference to the
list of elements, given as strings, in the original full set.

$answer_sets, e.g. [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], ...], is an array reference to a list of
array references corresponding to the correct answer which is a set of subsets.
Each subset element is specified via the index of the element in the $full_set,
with the first element having index 0.

Available Options:

    DefaultSubsets    => <array reference>
    OrderedSubsets    => 0 or 1
    AllowNewBuckets   => 0 or 1
    BucketLabelFormat => <string>
    ResetButtonText   => <string>
    AddButtonText     => <string>
    RemoveButtonText  => <string>

Their usage is demonstrated in the example below.

        # added by the user if AllowNewBuckets is 1.  This string should contain
        # exactly one instance of %s.  The default value if not given is
        # undefined.
        BucketLabelFormat => 'Subset %s'

        # This is the text label for the button shown that resets the drag and
        # drop element to its default state.  The default value if not given is
        # "Reset".
        ResetButtonText => 'zurÃ¼cksetzen'

        # This is the text label for the button shown that adds new buckets.

        # The default value if not given is "Add Bucket".
        AddButtonText => 'Add Subset'

        # This is the text label for the remove button that is added to any
        # removable buckets.  The default value if not given is "Remove".
        RemoveButtonText => 'Delete'

        # These are options that will be passed to the $draggable->cmp method.
        cmpOptions => { checker => sub { ... } }
    );

    BEGIN_PGML
    Let [``G = D_3 = \{ e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2 \}``] be the Dihedral group of
    order [`6`], where [`r`] is counter-clockwise rotation by [`2\pi/3`], and
    [`s`] is the reflection across the [`x`]-axis.

    Partition [`G = D_3`] into *right* cosets of the subgroup
    [`H = \{ e, s \}`].

    Give your result by dragging the following elements into separate buckets,
    each corresponding to a coset.

=head1 CUSTOM CHECKERS

A custom checkers can also be used by passing the C<list_checker> option to the
C<cmp> method.  See L<https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Custom_Answer_Checkers_for_Lists>
for details on how to use a custom list checker.  This follows the usual rules
for the return value of the C<list_checker> method.

Note that the correct and student answers will be Perl arrays containing
MathObject Lists corresponding to all buckets in the answer.
