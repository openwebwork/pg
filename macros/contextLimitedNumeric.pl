=head1 NAME

contextLimitedNumeric.pl - Allows numeric entry but no operations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements a context in which numbers can be entered,
but no operations are permitted between them.

There are two versions:  one for lists of numbers
and one for a single number.  Select them using
one of the following commands:

	Context("LimitedNumeric-List");
	Context("LimitedNumeric");

(Now uses Parser::Legacy::LimitedNumeric to implement
these contexts.)

=cut

loadMacros("MathObjects.pl");

sub _contextLimitedNumeric_init {

  my $context = $main::context{"LimitedNumeric-List"} = Parser::Context->getCopy("LimitedNumeric");
  $context->{name} = "LimitedNumeric-List";
  $context->operators->redefine(',');

  main::Context("LimitedNumeric");  ### FIXME:  probably should require the author to set this explicitly
}
