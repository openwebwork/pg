=head1 NAME

dangerousMacros.pl - Macros which require elevated permissions to execute.

=head1 SYNPOSIS

	loadMacros(macrofile1,macrofile2,...)
	
	insertGraph(graphObject); # returns a path to the file containing the graph image.
	
	tth(texString); # returns an HTML version of the tex code passed to it.
	
	alias(pathToFile); # returns URL which links to that file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dangerousMacros.pl contains macros that use potentially dangerous functions like
require and eval. They can reference disk files for reading and writing, create
links, and execute commands. It may be necessary to modify certain addresses in
this file to make the scripts run properly in different environments.

This file is loaded implicitly every time a new problem is rendered.

=for comment

FIXME this information belongs in global.conf where modules to load are listed.
I don't see why this shows up here.

=head2 Sharing modules

Most modules are loaded by dangerousMacros.pl

The modules must be loaded using require (not use) since the
courseScriptsDirectory is defined at run time.

The following considerations come into play.

=over

=item *

One needs to limit the access to modules for safety -- hence only modules in the
F<courseScriptsDirectory> can be loaded.

=item *

Loading them in dangerousMacros.pl is wasteful, since the modules would need to
be reloaded everytime a new safe compartment is created. (I believe that using
require takes care of this.)

=item *

Loading GD within a safeCompartment creates infinite recurrsion in AUTOLOAD
(probably a bug) hence this module is loaded by translate.pl and then shared
with the safe compartment.

=item *

Other modules loaded by translate.pl are C<Exporter> and C<DynaLoader>.

=item *

PGrandom is loaded by F<PG.pl>, since it is needed there.

=back

The module name spaces loaded in dangerousMacros are:

	PGrandom (if not previously loaded)
	WWPlot
	Fun
	Label
	Circle

in addition the subroutine &evaluate_units is shared from the module Units.

# =head2 loadMacros
# 
# 	loadMacros(@macroFiles)
# 
# loadMacros takes a list of file names and evaluates the contents of each file. 
# This is used to load macros which define and augment the PG language. The macro
# files are searched for in the directories specified by the array referenced by
# $macrosPath, which by default is the current course's macros directory followed
# by WeBWorK's pg/macros directory. The latter is where the default behaviour of
# the PG language is defined. The default path is set in the global.conf file.
# 
# Macro files named PG.pl, IO.pl, or dangerousMacros.pl will be loaded with no
# opcode restrictions, hence any code in those files will be able to execute
# privileged operations. This is true no matter which macro directory the file is
# in. For example, if $macrosPath contains the path to a problem library macros
# directory which contains a PG.pl file, this file will be loaded and allowed to
# engage in privileged behavior.
# 
# =head3 Overloading macro files
# 
# An individual course can modify the PG language, for that course only, by
# duplicating one of the macro files in the system-wide macros directory and
# placing this file in the macros directory for the course. The new file in the
# course's macros directory will now be used instead of the file in the
# system-wide macros directory.
# 
# The new file in the course macros directory can by modified by adding macros or
# modifying existing macros.
# 
# =head3 Modifying existing macros
# 
# I<Modifying macros is for users with some experience.>
# 
# Modifying existing macros might break other standard macros or problems which
# depend on the unmodified behavior of these macors so do this with great caution.
# In addition problems which use new macros defined in these files or which depend
# on the modified behavior of existing macros will not work in other courses
# unless the macros are also transferred to the new course.  It helps to document
# the  problems by indicating any special macros which the problems require.
# 
# There is no facility for modifying or overloading a single macro. The entire
# file containing the macro must be overloaded.
# 
# Modifications to files in the course macros directory affect only that course,
# they will not interfere with the normal behavior of WeBWorK in other courses.

# not translated completely.  Macintosh users must use the "MacRoman" encoding
